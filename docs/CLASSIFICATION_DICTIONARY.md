# KhmerHire Classification Dictionary

- Task ID: GH-ISSUE-13
- Dictionary version: 1.0
- Status: Draft for WorkBuddy Khmer taxonomy review
- UI language order: Khmer, English, Chinese

## 1. Dictionary contract

Each canonical concept has:

- stable code;
- Khmer label;
- English label;
- Chinese label;
- approved aliases;
- parent code;
- matching behavior;
- reviewer status;
- version.

Canonical codes never change when a display label is translated or renamed.
Aliases are many-to-one and must not create a new occupation unless a reviewer
approves the distinction.

## 2. Job-family taxonomy

WorkBuddy must verify Khmer wording, local usage and whether any family should
be split or merged before implementation.

## 3. Employment and work-mode values

| Code | Khmer | English | Chinese |
|---|---|---|---|
| FULL_TIME | ពេញម៉ោង | Full-time | 全职 |
| PART_TIME | ក្រៅម៉ោង | Part-time | 兼职 |
| CONTRACT | កិច្ចសន្យា | Contract | 合同 |

| KM | ភាសាខ្មែរ | Khmer | 高棉语 |
| EN | ភាសាអង់គ្លេស | English | 英语 |
| ZH | ភាសាចិន | Chinese | 中文 |

Proficiency values are BASIC, WORKING, PROFICIENT and EXPERT. Evidence values
are SELF_REPORTED, DOCUMENTED, ASSESSED and EMPLOYER_CONFIRMED. The language
used by the app is never an evidence value.

## 5. Skill normalization examples

| Canonical code | Khmer label | English label | Chinese label | Approved alias examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SKILL_CUSTOMER_SERVICE | សេវាកម្មអតិថិជន | Customer service | 客户服务 | cashier service, front desk service |
| SKILL_SALES | ការលក់ | Sales | 销售 | sales representative, sales promoter |
| SKILL_EXCEL | Microsoft Excel | Microsoft Excel | Microsoft Excel | spreadsheet, Excel |
| SKILL_DRIVING | បើកបរ | Driving | 驾驶 | driver, delivery driving |

| SKILL_ACCOUNTING | គណនេយ្យ | Accounting | 会计 | bookkeeping, accountant |
| SKILL_PROGRAMMING | សរសេរកម្មវិធី | Programming | 编程 | software development, coding |

These examples are seed entries only. WorkBuddy must validate local Khmer
aliases before they can satisfy a hard requirement.

## 6. Reason-code dictionary

| Code | Meaning | Display behavior |
|---|---|---|
| SKILL_MATCH | Canonical skill overlap | Show matched skill and source |
| ROLE_MATCH | Occupation/title fit | Show job family and role concept |
| EXPERIENCE_MATCH | Relevant experience fit | Show months or evidence band |
| LOCATION_MATCH | Location/commute fit | Show coarse location only |
| LANGUAGE_MATCH | Required language fit | Show language and evidence level |
| SCHEDULE_MATCH | Schedule compatibility | Show matching schedule fields |
| SALARY_COMPATIBLE | Salary ranges overlap | Show currency and period |
| MISSING_REQUIRED_DATA | Important data unknown | Ask for the missing field |
| HARD_REQUIREMENT_FAILED | Explicit requirement not met | Show the requirement and stop eligibility |
| TRANSLATION_UNCERTAIN | Translation or mapping uncertain | Show review flag and lower confidence |
| STALE_RECORD | Record may be outdated | Show retrieved/published date |
| SOURCE_CONFLICT | Permitted sources disagree | Show needs-review state |

## 7. Classification statuses

- AUTO_ACCEPT: canonical mapping above the approved confidence threshold.
- REVIEW_REQUIRED: ambiguous Khmer phrase, low confidence or source conflict.
- REJECTED: prohibited, invalid, expired or unusable source record.
- USER_CORRECTED: candidate or employer corrected a mapping; retain audit trail.

## 8. Normalization rules

1. Match aliases to canonical codes only within the correct job-family context.
2. Do not infer a skill from an employer brand, photo or person's name.
3. Do not infer language proficiency from interface language or script.
4. Keep both original text and canonical code.
5. Preserve negation: "no experience required" is not an experience
   requirement, and "not required to speak Chinese" is not a Chinese-language
   requirement.
6. Preserve requirement strength: required, preferred and optional are
   different values.
7. If a phrase maps to multiple codes, return REVIEW_REQUIRED.
8. Every new alias needs a source example, language, reviewer and dictionary
   version.

## 9. Review checklist

WorkBuddy should verify:

- Khmer labels sound natural to Cambodia job seekers and employers;
- English and Chinese labels preserve the canonical meaning;
- aliases do not merge distinct occupations;
- negation and requirement strength survive normalization;
- language labels are not confused with UI locale;
- hard-requirement concepts have exact-equivalence markers;
- synthetic examples cover the high-volume job families.
